# Computer game sales research
## Description:
From open sources, historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available. It is necessary to identify the patterns that determine the success of a game. This will allow us to bet on potentially popular products and plan advertising campaigns.
## Tools:
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, stats, skim, clean_columns, ydata_profiling
Data pre-processing, Exploratory data analysis, Creating a portrait of the user in each region (North America, Europe, and Japan), Hypothesis testing, General conclusion regarding the results of the analysis.
## Goal:
to identify patterns that determine game success and highlight popular products for 2017 sales forecasting and advertising campaign planning.
## Conclusion:
Analyzed the impact of user and critical reviews on sales - Critical and user reviews show a direct, weak correlation with sales**. In some cases, user reviews do not correlate with sales (e.g. 3DS and X360). 
In 2016 PS4, 3DS, XOne are leading in sales. Considering the year of release of the platforms (2013, 2011 and 2013 respectively) and the average period of popularity of the platform (about 7 years) **potentially profitable of them could be PS4 and XOne.**
The most popular platforms are X360, PS4 and XOne: these platforms have the highest median and most of the values are above it. 
The most popular **genres** are Shooter, Sports and Platform.
## Project Status:
