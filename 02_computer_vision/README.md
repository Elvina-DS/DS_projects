# Age Estimation for Customers
## Description:
The retail supermarket "Bread-Salt" is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo capture at the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
* Analyze purchases and suggest products that may interest customers in that age group.
* Control the cashiers' compliance when selling alcohol.
## Tools:
Keras, PIL, NumPy, Pandas.
Neural Networks, ResNet50, Augmentation.
## Goal:
Build a model that can approximate a person's age based on their photo.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the MAE values for the training and test sets were obtained: 2.3875 for training and 6.4712 for testing (indicating slight overfitting). This means that we have a model that can approximate a person's age based on their photo, with an error of approximately 6 years.
## Project Status:
Completed.
