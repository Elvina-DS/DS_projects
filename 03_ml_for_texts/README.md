This means that customers can suggest their edits and comment on other changes. The store needs a tool that will detect toxic comments and send them for moderation.
## Tools:
Scikit-learn, NLTK, re, torch, pandas.
Text preprocessing and vectorisation, Machine Learning model for natural language processing (BERT).
## Goal:
To train a model to classify comments as positive or negative.
## Conclusion:
The best overall result was achieved from RandomForestClassifier with BERT having a F1 score of 0.904.
## Project Status:
