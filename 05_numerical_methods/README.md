# Car Price Estimation
## Description:
The "Non-Accident, Non-Painted" used car sales service is developing an application to attract new customers. The app allows users to quickly determine the market value of their car. We have historical data available, including technical characteristics, configurations, and prices of cars.
## Tools:
Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, Catboost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Gradient bousting, machine learning, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, data scaling.
## Goal:
Build a model to estimate the price of a car.
The client emphasizes the following criteria:
* Prediction quality.
* Prediction speed.
* Training time.
## Conclusion:
Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that **the best model** for determining the price of a car is **CatBoost** (the model quality is 0.863, training time is 4.8, and prediction time is 0.0697).
## Project Status:
Completed.
