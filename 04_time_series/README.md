# Taxi Booking Forecasting
## Description:
There is historical data about taxi orders. It is necessary to build a model to predict the number of taxi orders.
## Tools:
LightGBM, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Pandas.
Time series, machine learning.
## Goal:
Is to build a model that predicts the number of taxi orders for the next hour to attract more drivers during peak demand periods. The metric value of RMSE on the test set should be no greater than 48.
## Conclusion:
Based on the obtained results, the **best model** for predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour is **CatBoost**. The RMSE metric value on the test set is 43.83 (satisfying the condition of not exceeding 48).
## Project Status:
Completed.
