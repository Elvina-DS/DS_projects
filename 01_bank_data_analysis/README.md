# Borrower Reliability Research
## Description:
The bank's credit department has requested research on what factors influence a borrower's reliability. A portrait of a trustworthy borrower must be created.
## Tools:
Pandas.
Data preparation, data preprocessing, data categorisation, data analysis
## Goal:
Identification of factors that have an impact on the timely repayment of the loan
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we can conclude that all the factors considered have an impact on the timely repayment of the loan.
* The results of the analysis showed that the more children, the higher the risk of default.
* Family borrowers and those who have been married at least once are less likely to default than single borrowers.
* High-income borrowers are more disciplined about repaying their loans than upper-middle-income borrowers.
* Different purposes of a loan affect its timely repayment in different ways - car loans and education loans are the riskiest.
