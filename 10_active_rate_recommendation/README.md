# Recommendation of the suitable active tariff for customers
## Description:
Mobile operator "Megaline" has found out that many customers are still using the archive tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new plan: "Smart" or "Ultra".
## Tools:
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn
Data splitting, Model exploration, Model evaluation on the test set, Model adequacy check.
## Goal:
Build a classification model that selects the appropriate tariff for the customer with the highest accuracy value (aiming for an accuracy rate of at least 0.75).
## Conclusion:
Based on the results, **the best model** for our classification task, with the highest accuracy in selecting the appropriate tariff, is the **random forest** model. 
## Project Status:
Completed.
