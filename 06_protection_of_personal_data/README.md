# Protection of Customer Personal Data
## Description:
It is necessary to protect the personal data of an insurance company's customers. Develop a data transformation method so that it would be difficult to reconstruct the original information and the quality of the linear regression would not change.
## Tools:
Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn.
Linear algebra, Machine learning.
## Goal:
to develop a data transformation method that makes it difficult to reconstruct personal information from the data. The goal is to protect the data while ensuring that the quality of machine learning models does not degrade.
## Conclusion:
The method of multiplication of the initial feature matrix by a random reversible matrix was used. There is a rigorous mathematical proof that this method of data transformation does not change the quality of linear regression.
## Project Status:
Completed.
