# Customer Churn Prediction
## Description:
The telecommunications operator wants to learn how to predict customer churn. If it appears that a user plans to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special conditions. The operator's team has collected personal data about some customers, as well as information about their tariffs and contracts.
## Tools:
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, phik, sklearn, catboost.
Data Exploration, Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Visualization.
## Goal:
is to build a model for predicting the probability of customer churn. The evaluation criterion for the model will be the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) metric, and the AUC-ROC value should be at least 0.88.
## Conclusion:
The **CatBoostClassifier** model demonstrated **the best performance** with an ROC-AUC metric value of 0.98.
## Project Status:
Completed.
