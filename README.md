# Data Science Projects

The following is general information about the projects and the tools used in the process.


| Project                 | Description               | Tools       |
| :--------------------  | :---------------------|:---------------------------|
| [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/01_customer_churn_prediction) | The telecommunications operator wants to learn how to predict customer churn. If it appears that a user plans to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special conditions. The project's goal is to build a model for predicting the probability of customer churn. | Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, phik, sklearn, catboost. Data Exploration, Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Visualization. |
| [Age Estimation for Customers](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/02_computer_vision) |  I have a set of photos with ages. I need to build a model that can determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. | Keras, PIL, NumPy, Pandas. Neural Networks, ResNet50, Augmentation. |
| [Project for "WikiShop" with BERT](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/03_ml_for_texts) |  I am given user comments with markup about the tone of the comment. I need to train the model to classify the comments as positive or negative. | Scikit-learn, NLTK, re, torch, pandas. Text preprocessing and vectorisation, Machine Learning model for natural language processing (BERT). | 
| [Taxi Booking Forecasting](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/04_time_series) |  There is historical data about taxi orders. It is necessary to build a model to predict the number of taxi orders. | LightGBM, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Pandas. Time series, machine learning. | 
| [Car Price Estimation](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/05_numerical_methods) |  I have historical data available, including technical characteristics, configurations, and prices of cars. I need to build a model to estimate the price of a car. | Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, Catboost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Gradient bousting, machine learning, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, data scaling. | 
| [Protection of Customer Personal Data](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/06_protection_of_personal_data) |  It is necessary to protect the personal data of an insurance company's customers. Develop a data transformation method so that it would be difficult to reconstruct the original information and the quality of the linear regression would not change. | Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn. Linear algebra, Machine learning. | 
| [Recommendation of the suitable active tariff for customers](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/10_active_rate_recommendation) |  I have data on the behaviour of customers who have already switched from archive tariffs to current tariffs. Using this data, I need to build a model that will offer the most appropriate tariff to users of the archive tariff. | Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn. Data splitting, Model exploration, Model evaluation on the test set, Model adequacy check. | 
| [Computer game sales research](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/11_computer_game_sales_research) |  From open sources, historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms vare available. It is necessary to identify the patterns that determine the success of a game. | Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, stats, skim, ydata_profiling. Exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, data preprocessing, visualisation.  | 
| [Identifying the best tariff plan](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/12_best_tariff_plan) |  I have received data on users of 2 tariffs. I need to analyse customer activity by plan and identify the most promising plan for a marketing campaign. | Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy. Data Preparation, data analysis, data preprocessing, hypotheses testing, visualization. | 
| [Research on Flats for Sale Advertisements](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/13_real_estate_data_analysis) |  I have at my disposal an archive of advertisements of flats for sale in St. Petersburg and neighbouring settlements for several years. It is necessary to determine the parameters that have the greatest influence on the valuation of the property. | Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy. Exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, visualization. | 
| [Borrower Reliability Research](https://github.com/Elvina-DS/DS_projects/tree/main/14_bank_data_analysis) |  The bank's credit department has requested research on what factors influence a borrower's reliability. A portrait of a trustworthy borrower must be created. | Pandas. Data preparation, data preprocessing, data categorisation, data analysis. |
