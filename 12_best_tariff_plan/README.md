# Identifying the best tariff plan
## Description:
Customers of the federal mobile operator Megaline are offered two tariff plans: Smart and Ultra. To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff is more profitable. I need to do a preliminary analysis of the plans on a small sample of customers. I have data on 500 Megaline users: who they are, where they come from, which tariff they use, and how many calls and messages each of them sent in 2018.
## Tools:
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.
Data Preparation, data analysis, data preprocessing, hypotheses testing, visualization.
## Goal:
To analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.
## Conclusion:
The difference in the average revenue from users on the Ultra and Smart tariffs is statistically significant, therefore we can pay more attention to the advertising of the Ultra tariff and promote it as a more premium and functional option. It was not possible to reject the null hypothesis that users from Moscow generate more revenue than users from other cities. 
## Project Status:
Completed.
